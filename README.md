(Daniel)Description: 
The project will be a android based app of a kitchen utilities app.  It will have three main features including a kitchen timer that can increment away from zero or towards it, a unit converter that can go from g to mg or g to mL^3 and etc., and a recipe multiplier where you enter ingredients and recommend serving size according to a recipe then enter for how many people or what multiple of servings is desired for a meal with an output of the correct measurement for each ingredient for that serving size.  To change between these we will have tabs at the bottom of the app that the user can click to switch from and to.
The timer will be a traditional kitchen timer than can be set with minutes and seconds and increment both ways.  This will probably be the most simple aspect of the app but we thought it would be very useful in the app since we are making it mind for kitchen use.
The unit converter will be able to do internal unit conversion and external unit conversion. For example it can change to the desired prefix weather it be milli- to centi- or etc. and can change units completely like going from grams to ounces or feet to meters.  Useful for kitchen and other possible measurements such as using a ruler or converting speed. 
The recipe multiplier is a special food conscious serving size multiplier.  In many cases when you want to double recipes you do not want to double every ingredient.  That is how you end up with too much salt and sugar in your food item.  Many ingredients that usually are added in smaller measurements aren’t to be double when doubling a recipe. The multiplier will have a input interface where the user can choose certain pre-choice items that will include the items that shouldn’t be just doubled in a recipe.  For the rest of the ingredients the user will be able write in the name of the ingredient and it will just be doubled, tripled, or multiplied to the user’s desired output. The actual multiply option will be a bar that can be toggled that ranges from .5x - 4.0x in increments of .5.
If possible we would like to expand the multiplier’s range, add more units to the converter, and possibly add any other useful kitchen utilities to the app that could include a 4th feature.

(Hua-Pei)Vision Statement: We are going create a kitch app that will do unit conversions and increase/decrease portions for recipe by entering what the normal portion is.

(Jacky)Motivation: This product will be developed for anyone who wants to have the task of cooking and measuring to be simplified and made easier with the convenience of their Android smartphone or tablet. The app is primarily targeted for users that will be in the kitchen and need an all-in-one app for the sake of convenience, but it can also be used by people who are doing science experiments, or simply need to convert units with ease.

(Joel)Risks: 1. Lack of experience with creating apps. 2. Lack of experience working in a group and using agile method. 3. Other commitments (other classes, work).

(Joel)Risk Mitigation Plan: 1. We have one group member that has experience with creating apps and we chose an app that would not be too complicated for beginners. 2. We will be meeting together regularly in 3308 and also in other classes that we have together so we will have plenty of time to talk through issues. 3. We will have backup plans for the essential parts of the app so if someone who is assigned an essential part cannot do it, there will be someone else that is ready to help. 

(Haotian)Version Control: For the version control, we use the github. The github is a web-based Git or version control repository and internet hosting service. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, features requesting and task management. And the repository in github can help us to manage the project and a set of files, as they change over time, it will store those information.

(Haotian)Development Method: For the development method, we use the agile.  Agile software developments refer to a group of software development methodologies based on the high iterative development, where the solution and requirements evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross functional team. The steps for the agile:1Focus on the customer value 2.iterative and incremental delivery3. Experimentation and adaptation 4. Self-Organization 5.Continuous Improvement 

(Hua-Pei)Collaboration Tool: group messaging

(Jacky)Proposed Architecture: We will most likely be using Android Studio for our frontend and that will be used to organize all of our code, emulate the app, and combine all the functionalities of the app. Our backend tool will be a Java IDE for all of our Java code which will include all the source code to run the app.
